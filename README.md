# Happie Signup Client

This application allows users to sign up for shifts at Happietaria Rotterdam. Happietaria is a non-profit pup up restaurant run by students in different cities in the Netherlands.

# Running the Signup Client

To run the signup client you will need a firebase api key. Make a copy of the `config.example.js` in the `src` directory, rename it to `config.js` and enter your firebase credentials.
